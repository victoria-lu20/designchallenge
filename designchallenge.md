**Introduction and Background**

One of the first steps to enabling the delivery of the Cloudflare Workers for Gaming offering to the market is conducting research to understand the problem space and target audience.

Some of the users that I found information on are involved in products, such as Sumer Game, Hive Jump, and Deep Rock Galactic (among others). These are individuals who have launched projects and games, and have faced difficulties in the process. 

What are some of the difficulties that game developers face? Based on the research that I conducted through the web, some key insights I found are:

-  users have a hard time finding funding, managing time allocation, and oversight on the project
- it is hard for users to measure the scope of the game (i.e. the niche of the game and how feasible ideas are/should be)
- users have a hard time finding PR and marketing, often times using trial and error when promoting the game at launch

That being said, the target audience is video game developers, since this product is designed and planned to enable video game developers to have a platform to plan and develop their ideas into games. Another consideration to have is market analysis on the target audience. It is estimated that there are around 2,500 companies supporting 220,000 jobs in the US market. However, there is also the global population, which needs to be taken account of, since Cloudflare Workers is an online platform that enables collaboration beyond country borders. With Tokyo and Paris being the top trending cities for game development, taking into account the global population of game developers brings the market size to be around over millions of developers catering to 2.5 billion gamers in the world. However, to have an estimate on the market size, I used the number of Cloudflare domain users, which is around 6 million users.

Some of the existing competitors in the game development market include companies and open-source CDNs, such as Nintendo, Valve Corporation, StackPath, Amazon CloudFront, and jsDelivr. By understanding competitors - what they exceed in and what they fall short on - enable better understanding of the problems that the users are facing and how to better design and produce products to cater them.

These statistics and research are just the tip of the iceberg in helping to understand the community of game developers. However, this information will aid in the brainstorming and the production stages of the product.  

**Brainstorming**

After researching the market space, target audience needs and problems, it is time to brainstorm ideas and assess the benefits and setbacks of the product.

One of the benefits that open source CDN provides for game developers is that it expands server capacity through points of presence (POPs) that speed up downloading speeds for users (i.e. gamers). By taking into consideration the benefits for the target audience of the gaming development industry, this point enables Cloudflare Workers to have a leading edge in the industry. Additionally, such a platform also enables better time allocation and scope prediction for users. With opportunities to improve performance, enhance security, and increase reliability, users can better focus on their projects.

Another benefit is that Cloudflare Workers operate on Javascript, which promotes both security and ubiquity. Compared to other options, such as Lua, Vx32, containers, etc., V8 has enhanced security, which enables users to code without worrying too much about the security aspect of their code.

Similarly, regarding marketing and PR, on such a large platform, users who use Cloudflare Workers can use platforms, such as Cloudflare Community to promote their games and/or ask questions and/or find individuals interested in the same projects and are interested in working together on a project. By using Cloudflare to branch off with users, game developers' problems regarding marketing and developing can be alleviated. Also, the ability for users to be able to easily scale up their projects enables a greater incentive for users to utilize such a platform for their projects due to the flexible nature of the product.

Regarding the value and feasibility of the project, both the value and feasibility are high. It is evident that this platform will help aid game developers in their mission to design games and finish projects. Helping to solve the target audience's problem space enables this product to have a high value as well. By being low-cost, fast, secure, and easy to scale, Cloudflare Workers is also a product provided by a platform that is one of the largest cloud network platforms that has shown its potential and strengths in the industry.

One of the things that needs to be done before the product launch is understanding the trajectory of the app and setting goals. By conducting formative user testing and summative tests from potential users, the team can better able understand the setbacks and strengths of the product, and make the last-minute changes needed before launch to ensure a successful product. Conducting user testing enables the team to see from the eyes of the user, and see what aspects of the product play into the toolboxes of these users and which aspects can be improved before the launch. This will greatly help the product launch more successfully. Additionally, setting goals will greatly help the success of the product. Perhaps, setting milestones along the way in metrics - success rate (i.e. how many users launched successful projects), time spent (i.e. how complex the product is) - will give the team a better idea and help measure the progress of the product.

**Conclusion and Takeaways**

Cloudflare Worker's open source CDN, operation with V8 Javascript, and incorporation of Cloudflare Community will prompt the success of the product in the market due to its enhanced speed and security and its alleviation of the target audience's problems.

However, there are risks that come with these final considerations. For example, more user research may need to be conducted, regarding both the target audience and the group that they are catering towards (i.e. their audience). By better understanding the needs of gamers, the team can better understand where the problems that game developers face may arise. Since the product is two-sided, with a client and their clients, it is essential to consider both sides. Another risk is that perhaps the marketing for the users may fall flat. It is inevitable that on a large platform, individuals' projects may not achieve the scope of recognizability that users may strive for regarding their games that they have developed. Perhaps, more research and understanding of the marketing aspect will better help alleviate this issue for users. A product is constantly evolving and changing to better fit the needs of the users.
